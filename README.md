# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on Object-Oriented programming based project which models the file transfer from a satellite to a device on a planet.<br>👯 I’m happy to collaborate with anyone, please send through a message so we can discuss the project :).<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with cracking the coding interview, specifically learning how to think critically and solve DSA problems with ease. If you have any resources please share them with me, I am happy to provide you any that have helped me :).<br>🌱 I’m currently learning OOP through Java and relational databases through postgreSql.<br>⚡ Fun fact - I spent the entirety of highschool believing that coding is an extremely boring and tedious activity. Fast-forward to now, I am currently in my second year of University studying a degree of computer science and engineering.
